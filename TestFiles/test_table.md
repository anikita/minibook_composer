# Testing Table Exclusion

This is a markdown file with a table that should be excluded from TTS processing by default.

## Sample Table

| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Data 1   | Data 2   | Data 3   |
| Data 4   | Data 5   | Data 6   |

Text after the table should still be included in the TTS output.

## Another section

This is another section that should be processed normally.
